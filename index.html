<p>The most interesting part about me is my interest and skill in music and audio production. I am the guitarist in an up and coming Portland alternative rock band (<a href="http://themacks.bandcamp.com">The Macks</a>) and I am currently producing one of our albums. I am also the engineer for the campus TV station, which involves sound work for live bands and show broadcasts.</p>
