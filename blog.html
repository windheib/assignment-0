			<li>The biggest problem I had with this assignment was getting comfortable with Git and GitHub and figuring out exactly how to publish and submit this assignment. While I had no prior experience with html, the coding was not too compicated and I was pretty quick at picking it up. I didn't know really anything before starting, but now I feel pretty confident in how Git works and interacts with what we will be doing in this class. I found the Piazza forum surprisingly helpful, thanks to some particularly well-meaning classmates that were willing to help us out online. In addition, basic html websites helped a lot, and living with someone that has done some web development before made the learning of the language (at least at the start) go over really well. </li>
